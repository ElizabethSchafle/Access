# Access

Access was my project for CS160 - User Interface Design and Development. The theme for the semester was creating apps for those with disabilities. This repository has been copied from the original github classroom repository, and thus no longer contains the commit history. 
For further information on my teams design process, please check out this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FLKIpXyAyKZlPaG3RW1_x5pE_ufdsMkW_21z_1ZcyiU/edit?usp=sharing

Access is an android app that uses crowdsourcing to rate buildings and other locations based on their accessibility to those with mobility impairments.
